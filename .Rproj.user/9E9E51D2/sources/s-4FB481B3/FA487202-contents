# Q 1 - There will be an object called 'iris' in your workspace. In this dataset,
# what is the mean of 'Sepal.Length' for the species virginica? Please round
# your answer to the nearest whole number.
class(iris)

# Q 2 - Continuing with the 'iris' dataset from the previous Question, what R
# code returns a vector of the means of the variables 'Sepal.Length',
# 'Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Length', and 'Petal.Width'?
